New features:
  - Go to http://localhost:3000/pilot_log/today.html directly and log in
  - Pagination

Changes:
  - "Personen importieren" statt "Stammdaten einspielen"

Notes:
  - Database is latin1, everything else is utf8, but it still works. Where is
	it converted, and how is the database charset determined? Why does it work
	if in database.yml the database encoding is set to utf8, but not when it is
	set to latin1?

Tests (test database):
  - without referer
  - CSV export with Excel

Permission system:
  - Two criteria: (a) login required no/non-local/always, (b) user's permissions
  - akaportal permission specification:
    - p1|(p2&p3)
	- resource:right (from database), resource.method?(user)
	  allows rights to resource classes and instances
  - akaportal permission usage:
    - In controller: permit 'spec', args, :only/except=>...
	  - permit x; permit y; => both required
	  - permit (w/o argument): actually a restriction (login required)
    - In action: permit 'spec', args do ... end
  - desired functionality:
    - determine whether action can be performed
	- no permissions set for action => disallow
  - if skip_filter :only is used more than once, the first is ineffective
