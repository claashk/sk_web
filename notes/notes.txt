New features:
  - Go to http://localhost:3000/pilot_log/today.html directly and log in

Notes:
  - Database is latin1, everything else is utf8, but it still works. Where is
	it converted, and how is the database charset determined? Why does it work
	if in database.yml the database encoding is set to utf8, but not when it is
	set to latin1?

Tests:
  - towflight extra works for other and unknown towplane
  - incomplete towpilot name
