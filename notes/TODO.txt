Critical (before release):
* login when no user exists
* only allow deletion of unused people
* delete confirmation without javascript
* Add: import master data
* Prevent deletion of flights/planes => remove resource routes
* Only allow operations with appropriate permissions
* for pilot_log, plane_log, flightlist, flight_db: displayed date range, and
  filename for 'today'
* Session store in database? Key in SVN?
* flight_db: separate towflights; format plugins

Major (important changes):
* paginated tables for resource lists and person selection
* layout for tex
* use yesno

Minor (less important changes or much work):
* When overwriting a person, display their number of flights
* route /person/1/overwrite/2
* "Create user" for person if there is none yet
* When using time_range, recover from ArgumentError (invalid date), redirect to
  the form, display an error message and preenter the (erroneous) values
* User not found: 404 or error message
* use alias_attribute in all models
* order of file formats
* better error reporting with latex files

Nice to have:
* define human_attribute_name instead of manual text specification
* date in local format
* consolidate tabel partial and table_for
* create/edit planes
* create/edit flights
