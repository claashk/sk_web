Critical:
* date range for pilot log and flight db
* remove create/edit flight actions
* utf8 characters in pdf fail
* Passwords not logged
* login when no user exists
* only allow deletion of unused people
* overwrite confirmation without javascript
* Add: import master data
* Prevent deletion of flights/planes => remove resource routes

Major:
* use table_for for all resource lists
* use table_for for person selection
* use alias_attribute in all models
* User not found: 404 or error message
* Session store in database? Key in SVN?

Minor:
* When overwriting a person, display their number of flights
* route /person/1/overwrite/2
* paginated tables for resource lists and person selection
* layout for tex
* use yesno
* "Create user" for person if there is none yet

Nice to have:
* define human_attribute_name instead of manual text specification
* date in local format
* consolidate tabel partial and table_for
