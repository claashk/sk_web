Critical (before release):
* Add: import master data
* Session store in database? Key in SVN?
* login when no user exists
  - allow login with sk_admin credentials
  - create user with sk_admin credentials if none exists => not usable for recovery
  - create any user on first connect => not usable for recovery
* Permissions: edit/create user grant permissions: sk_admin
* Permissions: not delete self
* Bug: today.csv

Major (important changes):
* Menu entries only for available actions
* paginated tables for resource lists and person selection
* layout for tex
* consider towflights for pilot log
* make it not break on flights with NULL date (Flight.new.save)
* Flight.<=> (and use sort instead of sort_by)
* Add towplane registration as comment if not known from launch type
* Can the _temp table duplication be supported through something like :finder_sql?
* Permissions: specify for all actions of a controller
* Permissions: allow exceptions to a permission for all actions of a controller
  (e. g. change own password)
* Permissions: make "require_login" override "require_permission" (?) and rename it
* Permissions: require_permission: require "perm, a" or "perm, [a, b, ...]"

Minor (less important changes or much work):
* make class DateRange
* When overwriting a person, display their number of flights
* route /person/1/overwrite/2
* "Create user" for person if there is none yet
* When using time_range, recover from ArgumentError (invalid date), redirect to
  the form, display an error message and preenter the (erroneous) values
* User not found: 404 or error message
* use alias_attribute in all models
* order of file formats
* better error reporting with latex files
* use :readonly=>true for all queries where applicable
* delete confirmation without javascript (http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2009/02/25/unobtrusive-destroy-links-in-rails-using-jquery)
* how to make sure not passwords are displayed? clear in view?
* look into fastercsv
* Download people CSV in format for import

Nice to have:
* date in local format
* consolidate tabel partial and table_for
* create/edit planes
* create/edit flights
* form error messages for individual inputs
