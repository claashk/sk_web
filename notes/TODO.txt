Critical (before release):
* SSL
* Menu entries only for available actions
* Test with real database
* Test CSV export with OpenOffice and Excel
* Read local IPs from config file (ApplicationController)
* Flightlist/plane log: only PDF for non-privileged users; proper format
  management (also others)
* Import people, review step: unmodified people
* Test w/o referer
* Error on config file not found
* style: non-breaking header cells in form tables
* file format description on import_select
* Person selection on create user


Major (important changes):
* style: table border transparent instead of white
* better redirect to origin - if multiple user edit windows are open, all of
  them will redirect back to the last one
* import errors: show club in tables
* flight model: add towplane and towpilot associations
* user model: rename to the_person
* redirect to origin does not work after user udpate if person selection was
  used
* lib/ file inclusion
* paginated tables for resource lists and person selection
* layout for tex
* consider towflights for pilot log
* make it not break on flights with NULL date (Flight.new.save)
* Flight.<=> (and use sort instead of sort_by)
* Add towplane registration as comment if not known from launch type
* Can the _temp table duplication be supported through something like :finder_sql?
* Permissions: specify for all actions of a controller
* Permissions: allow exceptions to a permission for all actions of a controller
  (e. g. change own password)
* Permissions: make "require_login" override "require_permission" (?) and rename it
* Permissions: require_permission: require "perm, a" or "perm, [a, b, ...]"
* Permissions: permission for granting permissions on edit and create user
* Text formatting for tables
* Import: all clubs and values tested should be stripped
* Create person/user: back to origin
* import people: undefinedness if the database is modified between identify and perform
* redirect_to :back: default values

Minor (less important changes or much work):
* Better error page (without flash)
* Buttons in overwrite_confirm: same form? Then remove table
* settings: plugin path
* flight: rename to the_launch_type
* delete uploaded import data on logout
* make class DateRange
* When overwriting a person, display their number of flights
* route /person/1/overwrite/2
* "Create user" for person if there is none yet
* When using time_range, recover from ArgumentError (invalid date), redirect to
  the form, display an error message and preenter the (erroneous) values
* User not found: 404 or error message
* use alias_attribute in all models
* order of file formats
* better error reporting with latex files
* use :readonly=>true for all queries where applicable
* delete confirmation without javascript (http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2009/02/25/unobtrusive-destroy-links-in-rails-using-jquery)
* how to make sure not passwords are displayed? clear in view?
* look into fastercsv
* Download people CSV in format for import
* Allow per-person club specification when importing
* Import: in unclear cases, let the user select candidates
* Import: if there are people with the same club or in another club: suggest
  :merge (for misspelled clubs)
* Import: let the use uncheck people
* Import: errors: don't display symmetric errors twice
* Import: errors: highlight erroneous fields
* Redirect back after login doeesn't work for debug on/off
* Add display of host/database
* Turn of debug: wrong redirect target?
* What happens if a user is deleted while logged in?
* Import person success message: pluralization
* Improve redirect after session settings, so deactivating debug from redirect
  page redirects back (but works correctly, even directly after activating)
* Read config file in initializer?

Nice to have:
* date in local format
* consolidate tabel partial and table_for
* create/edit planes
* create/edit flights
* form error messages for individual inputs
