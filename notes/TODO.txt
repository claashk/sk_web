Critical (before release):
* flight_db: format plugins
* Add: import master data
* Only allow operations with appropriate permissions
* Session store in database? Key in SVN?
* login when no user exists
  - allow login with sk_admin credentials
  - create user with sk_admin credentials if none exists
  - create any user on first connect

Major (important changes):
* paginated tables for resource lists and person selection
* layout for tex
* consider towflights for pilot log
* make it not break on flights with NULL date (Flight.new.save)
* Flight.<=> (and use sort instead of sort_by)

Minor (less important changes or much work):
* make class DateRange
* When overwriting a person, display their number of flights
* route /person/1/overwrite/2
* "Create user" for person if there is none yet
* When using time_range, recover from ArgumentError (invalid date), redirect to
  the form, display an error message and preenter the (erroneous) values
* User not found: 404 or error message
* use alias_attribute in all models
* order of file formats
* better error reporting with latex files
* use :readonly=>true for all queries where applicable
* delete confirmation without javascript

Nice to have:
* define human_attribute_name instead of manual text specification
* date in local format
* consolidate tabel partial and table_for
* create/edit planes
* create/edit flights
