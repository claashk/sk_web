Critical (before release):
* ssl redirect in htaccess, and add warning if ssl is off
* move Prawn::Document extensions out of rendering
* local date in pilot log and plane log
* remove latex options
* rename dispatch.fcgi

Major (important changes):
* Better handling of utf8 characters
* Templates
  * template for HTML file (yield body)
  * get rid of flight_count partial
  * get rid of date_range partial (use an escaper block)
* Error handling
  * Send mail on exception
* Overwriting
  * overwrite_select: removal of person collides with pagination
* Import
  * need to do 'dry run' to detect errors, e. g. club ID already taken on change
  * transaction does not seem to work: one created, one fails
  * unit tests for import
  * import errors: show club in tables
  * all clubs and values tested should be stripped (what about trailing blanks
    in database?)
  * import people: undefinedness if the database is modified between identify and
    perform
  * review: show names of unknown columns
* People list
  * Filter by club (also overwrite and person selection)
  * Filter a la portal
  * link to list_people: correct page
* PDF
  * Error handling in generate_pdf, for example: pstricks not installed
  * layout for tex
  * generate_pdf: option for calling LaTeX 1/2/3 times
* Models
  * Flight model: has_many :flights, :foreign_key => 'pilot' (and begleiter and
    towpilot); then use flights.count in Person.used?
  * flight model: add towplane and towpilot associations
  * user model: rename associated_person to the_person
  * Flight.<=> (and use sort instead of sort_by)
* User
  * Person selection on create user
  * user person_select: cancel button; requires: store original person in
    user[person], additionally new_person
  * subform: better controller subdivision; maybe store person under edit in
    session (but allow multiple!)
* Date
  * invalid date handling
* Style
  * table border transparent instead of white
* URLs
  * Improve automatic relative_url_root detection: only do once
  * better redirect to origin - if multiple user edit windows are open, all of
    them will redirect back to the last one
  * redirect to origin does not work after user udpate if person selection was
    used
  * Create person/user: back to origin
  * redirect_to :back: default values
  * redirect back after edit to correct page/with anchor
  * after reloading the login page, the origin is gone
  * add origin to login form instead of session => even works when cookies are
    disabled
* Statistics
  * consider towflights for pilot log
  * PlaneLogEntry.create_merged: add "Towflight" or "Towflights" to comments
    list
* Bugs
  * make it not break on flights with NULL date (Flight.new.save)
* Database
  * Can the _temp table duplication be supported through something like
    :finder_sql?
* Permissions
  * specify for all actions of a controller
  * allow exceptions to a permission for all actions of a controller
    (e. g. change own password)
  * make "require_login" override "require_permission" (?) and rename it
  * require_permission: require "perm, a" or "perm, [a, b, ...]"
  * permission for granting permissions on edit and create user
* Views
  * use thead and tbody for tables
  * Links to documentation
* Editing
  * delete confirmation without javascript
    (http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2009/02/25/unobtrusive-destroy-links-in-rails-using-jquery)

Minor (less important changes or much work):
* Templates
  * Layout for "box in stretcher"?
* Style
  * size of buttons and links is not the same for pagination
  * hover not for disabled pagination buttons
* Queries
  * people_list is very slow => prefetch all users (not so bad b/c paginated)
* Views
  * Buttons in overwrite_confirm: can they be in the same form? Then remove
    table
* Settings
  * plugin path
  * Read config file in initializer?
* Models
  * flight: rename to the_launch_type
  * use alias_attribute in all models
* Session
  * delete uploaded import data on logout
* Date
  * make class DateRange
* Routes
  * route /person/1/overwrite/2
* Editing
  * When overwriting a person, display their number of flights
  * "Create user" for person if there is none yet
  * prevent user taking "club administrator" from himself
* Error handling
  * When using time_range, recover from ArgumentError (invalid date), redirect
    to the form, display an error message and preenter the (erroneous) values
  * User not found: 404 or error message
  * better error reporting with latex files
  * What happens if a user is deleted while logged in?
* CSV
  * look into fastercsv
* Import
  * Allow per-person club specification when importing
  * in unclear cases, let the user select candidates
  * if there are people with the same club or in another club: suggest
    :merge (for misspelled clubs)
  * let the user uncheck entries
  * don't display symmetric errors twice
  * errors: highlight erroneous fields
  * Import person success message: pluralization
* URLs
  * Redirect back after login doeesn't work for debug on/off
  * Wrong redirect target when login for pilot_log, but no person
  * Improve redirect after session settings, so deactivating debug from redirect
    page redirects back (but works correctly, even directly after activating)
* Requests
  * move local_network? to request

Nice to have:
* consolidate tabel partial and table_for
* create/edit planes
* create/edit flights
* form error messages for individual inputs
* pagination like at erweiterungen.de

After launch types in database:
* :readonly=>true in lauch type queries
